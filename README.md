# study-time-mvc

Mini project completed to learn the basics of Python.

This is a mini programme with a user interface that is built using the Model-View-Control framework

To run this programme, you might need to have tkinter dowloaded on your computer. 

The programme aims to help its users schedule their time when studying for exams. It provides them with an estimate of 
how long it will take them to study all of their subjects by:

- Asking them for the name of a subject
- The number of pages required to study that subject
- The time they estimate it will take to study each page
- The programme then computes the estimate time to study the subject before calculating the sum of all the estimated times 
so the user knows how many hours it will take to study all subjects.
- The information is saved to a database and can be retrived by loging in

Functionalities of the programme could be extended to include the deadlines of each subject and ask the user how many hours 
per week they intend to study so an estimate of whether the user has enough time to study, how many breaks they can take, or if perhaps 
they need to prioritise can be provided. 

As the number of users of the programme increase; the idea would also be to assist the user in estimating the time it takes to study each 
subject by pulling on previous data inputted by other users for similar subjects.
